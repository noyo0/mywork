# Program finds square root of a givennumber with Newton-Raphson Method
# Created function "fn_newton" with three arguments; number, accuracy, display. 
# "number" argument sets the number to calculate with, 
# "accuracy" determines maximum number of digits (default:17), 
# "display" argument determines if the result is displayed as floating point number (default:0) or an integer (1)
# Program runs until max accuracy is reached;
# I noticed that while infinite iterations, python limits the number of digits at 17 and after reaching max accuracy the results are repeating.
# Exploiting this "feature" the program can store results in a container and check current result against previous iteration. 
# If the two are the same, there is no need to iterate any more, the result is the most accurate and final.
