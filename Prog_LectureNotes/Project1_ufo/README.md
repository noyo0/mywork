Programming for Data Analysis

The main purpose of the README is just introduce anyone who would visit your repository on how to get it running, what dependencies are used, maybe even what imports.
How do you get this running in terms of instructions and how to run the Jupiter notebook or the way you're running the Jupiter notebook, like that kind of stuff?

It's kind of so it's it's it's it's, it's like mesh of data, it's like documentation about the files, how to run them, what they are even let's say if you have included I see SVG file or a data set image that you're importing, analyzing and then synthesizing off the back of you know you might introduce that file and the readme but the references just answer someone's question and it's probably relevant for everybody.
